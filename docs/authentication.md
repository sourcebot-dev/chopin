# Authentication and authorization

Authentication covers the browser product, WebSocket, local MCP, repository
tools, and Copilot. A verified GitHub user supplies presence and attribution.
Optional instance admission lists restrict who may use Chopin. Browser routes,
WebSockets, and the hosted agent intersect the user's repository role with the
GitHub App installation. Local MCP instead checks the repository role granted
directly to its caller-supplied bearer token.

## GitHub App

Create one GitHub App for each deployment. Use these registration settings:

```text
Homepage URL: <APP_ORIGIN>
Callback URL: <APP_ORIGIN>/auth/github/callback
Setup URL:    <APP_ORIGIN>/auth/github/setup
```

- Leave **Expire user authorization tokens** enabled.
- Leave **Request user authorization (OAuth) during installation** disabled.
- Leave device flow disabled.
- Enable **Redirect on update** when a setup URL is configured.
- Disable webhooks.
- Select **Any account** so personal accounts and organizations can install it.
- Prefer **Only select repositories** while installing it.

Repository permissions for the complete product are:

```text
Contents:        Read-only
Pull requests:   Read-only
Checks:          Read-only
Commit statuses: Read-only
Metadata:        Read-only (automatic)
```

Contents backs file, tree, code-search, and commit-history tools. The other
read-only permissions back the hosted GitHub MCP pull-request toolset. Chopin
does not request repository, organization, or account write permission. An
`AGENT=off` deployment only needs Contents and automatic Metadata access unless
organization admission is enabled.

Organization admission additionally requires:

```text
Organization permissions:
Members: Read-only
```

The App must be installed on every allowed organization, and an organization
owner must approve this permission. Existing installations continue with their
old permissions until the owner approves the update.

No App ID, private key, JWT, installation access token, or webhook secret is
used. Chopin acts on behalf of each signed-in user with a GitHub App user access
token so repository-role checks remain tied to that user. In Copilot mode the
user also supplies the model entitlement. In Anthropic mode a separate deployment
API key supplies inference; it never replaces GitHub repository authorization.

Configure Chopin with the App's slug and OAuth client credentials. A minimal
production environment contains:

```text
STORAGE_DRIVER=postgres
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://<user>:<password>@<database-host>:5432/<database>
APP_ORIGIN=https://chopin.example
GITHUB_APP_SLUG=chopin-example
GITHUB_APP_CLIENT_ID=...
GITHUB_APP_CLIENT_SECRET=...
GITHUB_ALLOWED_USERS=octocat,hubot
GITHUB_ALLOWED_ORGANIZATIONS=githubnext
SESSION_ENCRYPTION_KEY=<64 hex characters>
```

The client ID is distinct from the numeric App ID. Generate the encryption key
with `openssl rand -hex 32`; it protects the short-lived OAuth attempt cookie,
including state, the PKCE verifier, and an optional browser return path.

`APP_ORIGIN` must be exactly one HTTP(S) origin: no credentials, path, query,
fragment, or trailing slash. HTTPS is required except for loopback development,
such as `http://127.0.0.1:8787`. Callback URLs are built only from this value,
never from incoming Host or forwarded headers.

The complete variable reference and deployment procedures live in
[Self-hosting](self-hosting.md).

## Instance admission

`GITHUB_ALLOWED_USERS` and `GITHUB_ALLOWED_ORGANIZATIONS` are optional,
comma-separated, case-insensitive GitHub login lists. If both are empty or
unset, every verified GitHub user is admitted. If either has entries, a user is
admitted when their current username is listed or they have active membership
in any listed organization. Explicit usernames therefore also provide a
break-glass path when organization verification is unavailable.

Organization checks use the caller's token with
`GET /user/memberships/orgs/{org}`, which sees private membership when the App
has Members read access. Pending invitations and outside collaborators are not
admitted, nor are billing managers who are not organization members.
Public-membership lookup is not used. Organization admission does not restrict
repository ownership. Browser and hosted authorization retain separate App
installation and repository role checks; local MCP checks the supplied token's
repository role directly.

Admission results are cached by a hash of the access token for 30 seconds.
Browser requests, open-socket authorization, MCP requests, and Planner
permission callbacks recheck the policy. A definitive removal revokes the
process-local browser session and Planner ownership at the next browser or
socket recheck; a Planner permission callback refuses the operation immediately. GitHub outages,
rate limits, malformed responses, blocked Apps, and missing permission fail
closed for new requests but do not revoke an established browser session; they
are reported as a temporary `503` and retried later.

Configuration is read at process startup. Restart after changing either list;
startup already clears every process-local login session. GitHub usernames and
organization names can be renamed, so update the lists when that happens.

## Authorization and installation

Authorization and installation are separate GitHub App operations. A user may
authorize the App without installing it. After sign-in, Chopin lists only the
personal and organization installations that user can access and only the
repositories selected for each installation. The repository picker links to
the App installation page when access has not been installed or needs updating.

The picker loads every repository page in the background and keeps a validated
snapshot for the lifetime of the browser tab. Stale snapshots are revalidated
page by page with GitHub ETags when search begins. The snapshot is scoped to the
GitHub user and cleared on logout, account changes, and the installation setup
callback. Listing responses remain `no-store`; the server forwards conditional
requests but does not retain picker repository data.

Local MCP is an intentional exception to this installation boundary. Its bearer
token is authenticated independently and authorized with a direct repository
lookup. An MCP-created document for a repository outside the App installation is
not available through browser routes, WebSockets, or the hosted agent until
the installation includes that repository. See [Local agent MCP](local-agent-mcp.md).

The authorization-code flow uses state, S256 PKCE, the exact configured
callback, and the App client secret. It does not request OAuth scopes;
permissions come from the App registration and each installation. The setup
callback ignores GitHub's untrusted `installation_id` query parameter, clears
the browser's installation snapshot, and redirects into the product. The next
picker or authorization request re-queries GitHub with the signed-in user's
token.

When a signed-out browser opens a document deep link, the sign-in request sends
the current path, query, and fragment as `return_to`. Chopin accepts only one
validated root-relative product path, stores it inside the encrypted OAuth
attempt cookie, and redirects there after a successful callback. Absolute and
protocol-relative URLs, control characters, backslashes, and API, auth,
WebSocket, or MCP paths fall back to `/`; a callback query cannot override the
stored value. GitHub App installation setup remains separate: its callback still
ignores return paths and redirects to `/?repository_access=changed`.

Organization members may need an owner to approve installation or new
permissions. For an organization using SAML SSO, establish an active SAML
session before authorizing. If organization repositories remain absent, revoke
the App under **Authorized GitHub Apps** and authorize it again while that SAML
session is active.

Webhooks are intentionally disabled for self-hosted deployments. Installation,
repository-selection, and revocation changes are observed through request-time
checks with a cache no longer than the one-minute open-socket recheck interval.

Environment-specific callback and proxy configuration is documented in
[Remote development](exe-dev.md).

## Session boundary

The browser receives an HttpOnly, SameSite=Lax cookie containing a random
session ID and a 256-bit secret. The serving process keeps the secret hash,
GitHub access and refresh tokens, expirations, user, and credential revision in
memory. PostgreSQL receives only the session ID, user ID, expiry, and creation
time so durable Planner ownership can reference an active process session. A
database row or session ID cannot authenticate a request without the in-memory
secret hash.

GitHub App user access tokens expire after eight hours. Chopin refreshes five
minutes early, rotates the one-use refresh token, and atomically replaces the
process-local credential object. Concurrent requests share one refresh. Logout
removes the memory entry before any asynchronous cleanup, so a racing refresh
cannot resurrect a session.

A rejected refresh token or a second API `401` deletes the matching local
session. Network failures, rate limits, malformed responses, and GitHub `5xx`
responses do not delete it. A transient proactive refresh may continue using
the still-valid access token; after access expiry it reports a temporary error
and retains the session for retry.

Sessions expire absolutely after 30 days or whenever the server process stops.
After acquiring the database writer lease, every new process clears session
registry rows and Planner ownership before accepting traffic. Documents,
transcripts, reserved Planner context fields, and repository installations
remain durable. Logout deletes the process-local session and registry row but
does not revoke the GitHub App authorization.

OAuth state, the PKCE verifier, and the validated browser return path are held in
a separate encrypted, ten-minute HttpOnly cookie. Browser state-changing routes
and WebSocket upgrades require an Origin header exactly equal to `APP_ORIGIN`.
The bearer-authenticated MCP route accepts a missing Origin, as non-browser
clients normally omit it, but rejects a present mismatched Origin. Open sockets
periodically recheck the process-local session, instance admission, and
installation repository permission. A browser whose socket reconnects after a
restart is returned to sign-in.

When a credential rotates, any Planner SDK session holding the previous token
is aborted and discarded before refresh. A later turn recreates it from the
durable transcript and document. An interrupted turn is not replayed
automatically because it may already have made durable tool changes.

## Browser HTTP API

```text
GET  /auth/github
GET  /auth/github/callback
GET  /auth/github/install
GET  /auth/github/setup
GET  /api/session
GET  /api/github/installations?page=1
GET  /api/github/installations/:installationId/repositories?page=1
GET  /api/repositories/:owner/:repository/channels
POST /api/repositories/:owner/:repository/channels
GET  /api/repositories/:owner/:repository/documents/:slug
GET  /api/channels/:channelId
PATCH /api/channels/:channelId
POST /api/channels/:channelId/agent/reset
POST /auth/logout
```

The repository-scoped document endpoint backs readable browser URLs. Existing
UUID routes remain internal API and collaboration entry points.

API and authentication paths are owned by the server in development and
production.

Live collaboration is multiplexed over `/ws`. External coding agents use the
separate Streamable HTTP endpoint at `/mcp`; unlike the browser API, its
caller-supplied bearer is independent of the GitHub App installation and can
perform write-authorized document and implementation lifecycle operations.
