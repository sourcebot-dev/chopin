# Hosted agent (Planner)

Chopin's document agent is currently named Planner. It can
inspect one selected GitHub repository, co-author the shared document, ask the
participants structured questions, and anchor decisions to prose. For documents
used as plans, it can also draft an implementation graph. It does not implement
code or change GitHub.

The product role is document co-authoring. The current prompt and tool vocabulary
remain optimized for planning and may structure another document type as a plan;
that is an implementation limitation, not the document model's boundary.

## Ownership

The first eligible editor to invoke the Planner or start a model-backed research
request supplies the GitHub App user access token for that channel. Copilot
inference also uses that user's entitlement. With `AGENT_PROVIDER=anthropic`,
model calls instead use the deployment's Anthropic API key. The user must pass instance admission and have
repository push or administration access. Ownership is assigned atomically in
storage and guarded by a generation token.

That process-local login owns the channel's repository authorization until it expires, logs
out, the server restarts, or the authenticated reset API releases it. The
current web application does not expose a reset control. In Copilot mode, a user without Copilot
entitlement sees the provider failure on the first model-backed action and
remains owner until one of those release conditions occurs.

PostgreSQL stores the owner session ID only so durable ownership can refer to an
active process session. The cookie verifier and GitHub credential remain in
memory. Startup clears every browser-session registry row and owner reference,
while preserving the document, transcript, reserved context fields, and
ownership generation.

## Runtime isolation

The shared Copilot runtime runs in SDK `mode: "empty"`. Each disposable SDK
session has no client-level service token or logged-in-user fallback. Copilot
sessions receive the owner's token as their model credential. Anthropic sessions
receive a singular BYOK provider configuration with the deployment API key; the
owner token is supplied separately only to repository tools and GitHub MCP.
Private workers have no GitHub MCP server or model-level GitHub token in
Anthropic mode. Both modes retain the same owner and repository permission
checks.

The Planner has no:

- checkout, shell, or host filesystem;
- skills, plugins, or configuration discovery;
- repository-local instruction loading;
- shared embeddings or cross-session store; or
- ability to change GitHub.

Available capabilities are:

- Chopin document, question, relationship, and implementation-graph tools (with
  current plan-oriented tool names);
- bounded file and tree reads plus commit history fixed to the default branch
  captured when the SDK session is created;
- repository-scoped code search, post-filtered by repository node ID; and
- bounded reads of document and historical research references attached to the
  current Chat context; and
- repository-bound, read-only pull-request MCP calls.

Issue and general search MCP tools are refused because linked objects and
free-form qualifiers can cross the selected repository boundary. Repository
REST tools construct owner and repository coordinates on the server, bound
response sizes and line ranges, reject path escape, and post-filter code search
by GitHub repository node ID.

The Planner does not see a user's local checkout, current branch, working tree,
or uncommitted changes. A coding agent must compare the repository context
returned by Chopin with its checkout before claiming work. The server validates
the shape of creation provenance but does not resolve its branch and commit
against GitHub or independently inspect the coding agent's checkout.

## Permission checks

Before each custom or MCP tool executes, callbacks recheck:

- current instance admission;
- the owner process session and its user;
- ownership generation;
- credential revision and expiry;
- repository push or administration access; and
- the App installation's repository access.

Permission is decided before execution. A refusal therefore produces no normal
tool start or completion event; the Chat service renders permission
denials explicitly so the boundary remains visible.

The in-memory SDK session is bound to one credential revision. Before an
eight-hour GitHub App token refresh, Chopin aborts and discards every Planner
session using that revision. The next turn creates a fresh session with the new
token.

## Chat context

The channel chat transcript is durable, but not every historical message is sent to
every turn.

- Messages since the last turn are retained as immediate backscroll, capped at
  40 entries and normally 8,000 characters. One message is retained intact even
  when it alone exceeds that character budget.
- A recreated Copilot session receives at most the last 100 transcript entries
  and 50,000 characters. Reserved Planner transcript-summary and cursor fields
  exist in storage, but the current runtime does not advance them. Generated
  descriptions and legacy summaries under durable `document-summary@1` are
  separate and are not bootstrap context.
- The Planner reads the current document through the plan-named `read_plan` tool
  instead of receiving a stale embedded copy.

Chat references are typed server-side resources, not URLs the model can
follow. `#` selects another ordinary document in the current repository.
References persist with their message, but `read_reference` accepts only the
bounded set retained by the active Planner session. A document reference reads
latest canonical source and reports whether it changed since selection. New
messages no longer offer `%` research references; persisted references from the
removed Research Workspace interface still return a bounded compatibility
projection. Both forms are untrusted evidence, and neither changes the
room-fixed target of `read_plan` or editing tools.

Messages from people retain their GitHub handles so disagreement is not merged
into one anonymous user voice.

## Session lifecycle

Copilot CLI session files and SDK session IDs are disposable. A process restart,
credential rotation, logout, or ownership reset discards the SDK session. A
later turn bootstraps from the bounded transcript and reads the current document.

An interrupted turn is visible and is never replayed automatically because it
may already have made durable document or question changes. `session.send()` only
accepts a message; the Chat handler remains active until the SDK emits
its idle event.

The runtime starts lazily on the first Planner turn or model-backed worker
attempt. `AGENT=off` prevents those turns, disables the background-job runner,
and avoids starting Copilot CLI. It does not disable `/mcp`, and the prototype UI
may still contain Planner-oriented explanatory copy.

## Background jobs

Background jobs are durable Chopin requests, not child Planner turns. Registered
definitions control their input and artifact codecs, enqueue origins, credential
mode, timeout, failure budget, declared progress, and artifact settlement. Every
model-backed stage uses a fresh disposable SDK session. Job output is not
automatically injected into Chat or recreated Planner context, although
the Planner may explicitly read an artifact in a later turn.

An inline `/research` submission persists the exact brief and starts work
immediately. During an explicit member turn, the Planner can call the
plan-named `create_research_workspace` tool with that same exact brief; it may
not refine, broaden, or replace it. The public worker receives only the brief.
Parent-document context goes to a separate no-web worker after evidence
completes. A validated initial report publishes as an ordinary child document;
it never edits the parent's collaborative prose automatically.

Jobs with `credential: "active-planner"` use the channel's process-local Planner
owner and entitlement, while fenced claims store no token. Full definition
registration, lifecycle, isolation, disclosure, retry, configuration, and
testing guidance is in [Background jobs and workers](background-jobs.md).

Generated document descriptions use this active owner in a private disposable
worker. The durable definition remains `document-summary@1`; marked V1 requests
produce one-line type, purpose, and subject metadata, while markerless legacy V1
artifacts remain readable only as summaries. The generated value is untrusted
model output and is neither the structured MCP creation `brief` nor the reserved
Planner transcript `summary`.

Open, edit, restore, and MCP creation paths schedule descriptions lazily. They do
not establish Planner ownership, and there is no unattended scan of every
document. Without an active owner, model-backed work cannot run; the last
completed description, if any, remains visible while work is pending or failed.

## Implementation graph status

The Planner can draft and revise a graph with `read_implementation_graph` and
`edit_implementation_graph`. It cannot approve, lock, or start implementation.
Those are explicitly human and coding-agent responsibilities.

The graph tools remain technically available in any channel, but the child
browser surface exposes no implementation or task destination. Child
implementation is therefore outside the supported product workflow. The
supported MCP handoff can read only graphs on MCP-created documents, and no
current production interface lets a person approve the draft. See
[Experimental implementation lifecycle](implementation-lifecycle.md).

## Main implementation points

- Planner prompt and tool boundary: `apps/server/src/agent/planner.ts`
- SDK client and available-tool filter: `apps/server/src/agent/client.ts`
- Permission callbacks: `apps/server/src/agent/permissions.ts`
- Repository-fixed tools: `apps/server/src/agent/repository.ts`
- Ownership and Chat lifecycle: `apps/server/src/chat/service.ts`
- GitHub App session lifecycle: `apps/server/src/auth/session.ts`
- Background job registry and runner: `apps/server/src/jobs/registry.ts` and
  `apps/server/src/jobs/runner.ts`

## Anthropic inference

`AGENT_PROVIDER=anthropic` uses the Copilot SDK's BYOK transport for Planner,
document descriptions, private document analysis, and report synthesis. The
runtime still ships with Chopin; a Copilot subscription is not required for
Anthropic inference. GitHub sign-in and App repository access remain required.
See [Self-hosting](self-hosting.md#anthropic-api-inference) for configuration.

After selecting a custom agent, Chopin checks the selected model against the
configured Anthropic model and refuses a mismatch. Runtime `assistant.usage`
events log the model and token counts, without prompts or credentials. These
logs provide evidence independent of an agent's self-description.

The SDK request handler removes `temperature`, `top_p`, and `top_k` from direct
Anthropic Messages requests. The pinned CLI adds a temperature that Fable 5.1
rejects; these requests use Anthropic's sampling defaults. Other endpoints pass
through unchanged, and responses retain streaming and cancellation support.

Public research uses Anthropic's Messages API directly with only the disclosed
query and the basic `web_search_20250305` server tool. It has no private document,
repository, filesystem, or client tools. Search results and citations must agree;
URLs in ordinary generated prose never establish source provenance. The existing
public HTTPS and artifact bounds apply before publication. The direct search
request preserves encrypted result and thinking blocks across `pause_turn`,
allows at most three requests with five searches each, limits each response to
2 MiB and 8,192 output tokens, and observes the job deadline and owner revocation.
Provider errors and incomplete responses fail the job without publishing a child.

GitHub's web-search MCP configuration is used only in Copilot mode. Private
analysis and synthesis stay in separate no-web SDK sessions in both modes.

`bun run test:anthropic` exercises the pinned CLI against a local mock Anthropic
endpoint, including rejection of deprecated sampling parameters, wire model/key
routing, streaming, tool permission checks, and terminal results. It requires
local socket access but no API key or Copilot login. It does not establish live model availability for a deployment's key.
